ClaimPoint — Smart Lost & Found Platform

Lost and Found Management System
1. Introduction
The Lost and Found Management System is a web-based application designed to help organizations efficiently manage lost and found items within their premises. It aims to digitalize and automate the traditional manual process of recording, tracking, and returning lost items, making the experience more secure, organized, and user-friendly.
This system can be integrated into any organization’s existing website — such as a railway station, bus terminal, airport, hospital, university, or other public facility — and serves as a centralized platform for both the organization’s authority and the general public.

2. Project Overview
The platform provides two main interfaces:
    1. Authority Panel (Admin/Staff Side)
Used by authorized personnel of the organization to manage all found items, verify claims, and handle item return processes.
    2. Public/User Panel
Accessible to the general public for reporting lost items or claiming found ones.
Both panels are interconnected through a shared database and a smart matching algorithm that uses AI-based similarity checking to automatically link lost and found reports.

3. System Workflow
A. When an Item is Found
    1. A lost item is discovered either:
        ◦ By organization staff, or
        ◦ By a general person within the organization’s premises who submits the item to the authority.
    2. The authority staff records the item into the system’s database by providing details such as:
        ◦ Item type
        ◦ Model or brand name
        ◦ Color, barcode, IMEI, serial number (if applicable)
        ◦ Date and place found
        ◦ Optional image of the item
    3. Only basic, non-sensitive details (e.g., model name and category) are displayed publicly on the website.
    4. The complete data remains in the backend for verification and matching.

B. When a User Loses an Item
    1. The user can report a lost item through the website by providing all available details they remember — for example:
        ◦ Model name
        ◦ Color
        ◦ Unique identifiers (IMEI, serial number, etc.)
        ◦ Approximate date and place of loss
    2. This report is stored in the database and automatically cross-checked against all found item entries using the system’s AI-based smart matching algorithm.
    3. If the system finds a high-probability match, it notifies both the user and the authority staff.
    4. The user is then asked to visit the office for manual verification, where staff confirm ownership through physical proof before returning the item.

C. When a User Claims a Found Item
    1. Users can browse the public list of found items (with limited details).
    2. If they believe an item belongs to them, they can submit a claim request by entering identifying details.
    3. The system automatically compares the claim data with the stored information in the database.
    4. The most matched claimant is notified.
    5. Upon visiting the authority, final manual cross-checking ensures the item is returned to the rightful owner.

4. Smart Matching (AI Integration)
The project includes an AI-based matching system to make the process more intelligent and efficient.
    • The algorithm compares multiple attributes (name, color, brand, serial numbers, and textual descriptions).
    • It uses similarity scoring to determine how closely a user’s lost report or claim matches a found item.
    • The system can prioritize top matches and notify the potential owners automatically.
This eliminates manual searching, reduces human error, and accelerates the recovery process.

5. Key Features
✅ Two-Way Reporting System – Handles both lost and found item entries.
✅ Admin Dashboard – Secure backend for authority to manage items, verify users, and approve returns.
✅ User-Friendly Public Interface – Simple and accessible for any visitor to report or claim items.
✅ Smart AI Matching – Automatically connects lost and found items using intelligent similarity logic.
✅ Notification System – Notifies matched users via email/SMS or in-app alerts.
✅ Data Security – Protects sensitive item data and personal details.
✅ Search & Filter – Users can easily search through found items.
✅ Scalable Integration – Can be embedded within existing websites of institutions or public authorities.

6. Target Users
    • Organizations / Institutions:
Railway stations, airports, bus terminals, hospitals, universities, shopping malls, etc.
    • General Public:
Anyone who has lost or found an item within those premises.

7. Expected Outcomes
    • Streamlined and transparent lost-and-found process.
    • Reduced manual effort for staff.
    • Faster and more reliable item recovery for users.
    • Improved trust and engagement between public and organizations.















before work with anything else, lets make plan about user entity first, listen to my things, let's make plan firsrt
listen first of all there are admin user, who can manage user's add user's like adding staff's to the database, they can do anything
and staff can do several things, like they found some item / or some item comes to them, then they will add this items to the database with additional info, whatever they can get from the product, not any specific hard-cored product detgit ails like model, it can vary from product to product, (you will need to tell me the way to handle that), then they can post for the items, with specific details they want, (you will need to tell me the way to handle that), then when somehow the item is returned to the owner they will delete the product from both place
and the last but not least general user, who will see the posted founded item, they can enter into product's part, and claim them, by giving the info they have ((you will need to tell me the way to handle that), this will stored in the databse with the id's of the found items, for later matching
they also have option to report lost product, which will be stored in the databse, later when new item is found they will be checked with this
listen one thing we will think about the mathing algorithm later, but now, as the staf can have access to all product they can also see which calimer's input matches with the product details from the staff from how percentange, they if it's more then certainain percentange, they staff can click something so that email goes to the user, and they can come and give proff physically and collect the item,
this is the thing i want lets first work with the users only, they we will work with the product and other things













Perfect — this is exactly the right point to stop and design things properly before coding.
We’ll build the entire user-role + permissions + responsibilities clearly before touching models, APIs, or UI.
Below is a clean, scalable, and future-proof plan for the User System of your ClaimPoint Smart Lost & Found platform.

✅ USER SYSTEM MASTER PLAN
We have 3 user roles:
1. Admin
    • Created manually or via database seeding.
    • Can:
✔ Create staff accounts
✔ Block/unblock staff
✔ View all logs, items, claims, activities
✔ System-level control

2. Staff
They work for the organization (airport, station, hospital, university, mall, etc.)
They can:
    • Add item found by them or handed over
    • Add custom details (not fixed fields — you asked how to handle that ⇒ solution below)
    • Create the “public post” for found items with selected fields
    • Remove/delete items after they are returned
    • View claim requests for their items
    • View lost reports (by users)
    • Approve match manually and trigger email notification to user
Think of STAFF as CLERKS at the Lost & Found Desk.

3. General User (Public)
They can:
    • Browse found items (public listing)
    • View limited detail page of each item
    • Submit claim request for a found item with any details they have
(You asked “how to store this?” → solution below)
    • Report their lost item
    • They cannot delete items
    • They cannot see backend data
